## General info
--------------------
Project It is a simple project management tool that allows you to create projects, tasks, and a team. As a project administrator, you can create tasks with deadlines and assign users to those tasks. Your tasks are then visually displayed so that you can see where they overlap and when things are due. [Visit the deployed site here](https://project-it-panda.herokuapp.com/)
